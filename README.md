#  Application with XPC Service and communication via XPC

**Magic 8 Ball** is a sample app, that imitates the [Magic 8 Ball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165832/mediaviewer/rm1258372352)  best known from the 'Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road' movie.
The application is intentionally simplified in order to serve as a working example for everyone, who wants to figure out how XPC Services work.

The XPC Service is called **MagicXPCService**, and this is where we get the answers to out question from. 

Both the main UI app and the XPC Service are sandboxed.
